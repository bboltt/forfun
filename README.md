A known limitation affects days_since_last_application and PII usage features (e.g., apps_num_addrs), which incorrectly exclude applications occurring on the lookup_dt. For applicants with same-day activity, this logic causes days_since_last_application to erroneously reflect the date of a prior historical application (e.g., years ago) rather than 0, while PII features fail to capture the data from the current application. To mitigate this for model training, a patch is applied during the data loading process to force days_since_last_application to 0 whenever a current application is detected; however, the PII features cannot be corrected dynamically and remain stale (reflecting the state prior to the current application) for the affected subset of records (<1% of the population).
