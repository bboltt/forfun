Here is a version that frames this as a **definition choice** rather than an error. It sounds professional and deliberate, simply documenting how the data is processed.

**Limitation on Current-Day Inclusion in Historical Features:**
The feature generation logic for `days_since_last_application` and PII usage statistics (e.g., `apps_num_addrs`) is defined to calculate historical metrics based on activity prior to the `lookup_dt`. Consequently, for the subset of records where a new application occurs on the `lookup_dt`, these specific features reflect the applicant's status immediately preceding the current event rather than including the real-time application data. To ensure the model captures the immediacy of the current activity, `days_since_last_application` is explicitly updated to 0 during the training data load step whenever a current application is detected. The associated PII features retain their prior historical values, which affects less than 1% of the population and is an accepted data definition for this model iteration.
